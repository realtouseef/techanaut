# Techanaut ðŸš€

Amazon Affiliate site built w/ NextJS, Contentful, Tailwind CSS, and Sass.

## Things to remember

1. anchor tag `<a></a>` inside and `h6` is the `Visit to Amazon` button

2. when new post is added in `contentful`, run `yarn build` to create static pages, and then run `yarn postBuild`, so sitemap is properly generated for `google bots`.

3. Manually add posts to `sitemap.xml`
